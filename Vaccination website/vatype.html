On 16 January 2021 India started its national vaccination programme against the SARS-CoV-2 virus which has caused the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The drive prioritises healthcare and frontline workers, and then those over the age of 60, and then those over the age of 45 and suffering from certain comorbidities.In January 2021 Secretary-General of the United Nations António Guterres said that India's vaccine-production capacity is the best asset the world has.
 According to health officials, India has administered 2,09,89,010 vaccine doses across the country as of 7 March 2021.</p>
<p id="p2">Pune-based Serum Institute of India announced that it would apply for clinical trials of certain strains from Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) in April 2020. As per company president Adar Poonawalla, a vaccine for COVID-19 will be delivered within a year. However, it may not be effective on 20 to 30% people</p>

On 1 January 2021, the Drug Controller General of India, approved the emergency or conditional use of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine AZD1222 (marketed as Covishield).
