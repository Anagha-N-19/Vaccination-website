<h1>Information about COVID-19 for Public</h1>
<p id="p1"><b>What is Corona virus? :</b>Corona viruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness
in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known
to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more
severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)
and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently
discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.</p>
<p id="p2"><b>What is COVID-19? :</b>COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently
discovered corona virus. This new virus and disease were unknown
before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. </p>
<p id="p3"><b>Symptoms of COVID-19:</b>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and
dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal
congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are
usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but
donâ€™t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people
(about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special
treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19
becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people,
and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure,
heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.
People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical
attention. </p>
